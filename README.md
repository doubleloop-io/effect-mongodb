### Document Your Changes

**Changeset Documentation**

Before committing your changes, document them with a changeset. This process helps in tracking modifications and effectively communicating them to the project team and users:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

During the changeset creation process, you will be prompted to select the appropriate level for your changes:

- **patch**: Opt for this if you are making small fixes or minor changes that do not affect the library's overall functionality.
- **minor**: Choose this for new features that enhance functionality but do not disrupt existing features.
- **major**: Select this for any changes that result in backward-incompatible modifications to the library.

## Release a new version

Merge the PRs automatically created on GitHub with the name "Version Packages".
